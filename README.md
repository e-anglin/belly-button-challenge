I used colors from Plotly colorscale for JavaScript. For app.js, W3Schools was a huge help for me, and I frequently revisited the tutorials to make sure I knew what I was doing.
D3js.org was also very helpful, and I practiced there first, before beginning the challenge. 
Populating the dropdown proved to be the most difficult and time-consuming. My co-worker Mike was able to help me with that. He learned something new as well, as he had never heard of D3 prior to assisting me with this challenge!
If I had more time to finish this assignment, I would find out why my gauge still isn't working. I will definitely come back to it.
